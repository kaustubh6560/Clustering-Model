# Clustering_Model
Applying KMeans clustering model on cars dataset.

Clustering is the task of grouping together a set of objects in a way that objects in the same cluster are more similar to each other than to objects in other clusters.
K-Means falls under the category of centroid-based clustering. A centroid is a data point (imaginary or real) at the center of a cluster. In centroid-based clustering, clusters are represented by a central vector or a centroid.
K-Means Cluster-then-predict where different models will be built for different subgroups if we believe there is a wide variation in the behaviors of different subgroups.
